## 📚 Study Guide Generator - How It Works

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\automations
.\\scripts\\ask-canvas.ps1 "Midterm Exam"

```

**What it does:**
1. 🔍 Searches Canvas for your test/exam
2. 📚 Fetches all course resources (slides, practice tests, readings)
3. 🤖 Uses GPT-4o-mini to create comprehensive study guide
4. 📄 Generates professional Word document (.docx)

$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 6:00AM  # Change to 6 AM
```

Then re-run the setup script.

```python
# Adjust the heuristic
hours = (points / 100) * 3  # Make estimates longer
```

### Customize Action Outlines

Edit the `generate_action_outline()` function to add/change steps based on assignment type.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"

Install Python:
```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

### "Module 'requests' not found"

Install dependencies:
```powershell
pip install requests
```

### "No assignments found" (but you know there are)

Check that:
1. Your Canvas API tokens are valid (`C:\Users\bryso\.claude\credentials\canvas.json`)
2. Assignments are published by instructors
3. Due dates are set correctly in Canvas

### "Telegram message not received"

1. Check your bot token and chat ID in `C:\Users\bryso\.claude\credentials\telegram.json`
2. Make sure you've started a conversation with your bot
3. Run the test script to see error messages

### Task not running automatically

1. Open Task Scheduler (Windows + R, type `taskschd.msc`)
2. Find "DailyCanvasPlanner" task
3. Right-click → Properties
4. Ensure "Run whether user is logged on or not" is checked
5. Ensure "Wake the computer to run this task" is checked

## 📊 Viewing Task History

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Find "DailyCanvasPlanner"
3. Click "History" tab to see all runs

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ Credentials are stored locally in `~/.claude/credentials/`
- ✅ Never committed to git (`.gitignore` is set)
- ✅ Only you have access to your Telegram bot
- ✅ Canvas API tokens are read-only

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Run Multiple Times Per Day

Add more triggers to the task:

```powershell
$Trigger1 = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 7:00AM
$Trigger2 = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 12:00PM
$Trigger3 = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 6:00PM

Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName $TaskName `
    -Action $Action `
    -Trigger @($Trigger1, $Trigger2, $Trigger3) `
    ...
```

### Check Upcoming Assignments (Next 7 Days)

Modify the `filter_due_today()` function to check a date range:

```python
def filter_due_this_week(assignments):
    today = datetime.now().date()
    week_from_now = today + timedelta(days=7)
    # ... filter logic
```

### Integrate with Project Architect

The script can be enhanced to call Claude API with the project-architect agent to generate even more detailed plans. (Future enhancement)
